    A fast, highly efficient plagiarism detection tool that spots clusters of plagiarists amongst the whole group. The unique feature of COMPOSITUS is it's ability to generate graphs of possible plagiarist groups with weighted edges that represent the matching fraction of documents.
    It essentially hashes n-grams of a plain text document to integer values and then compares the generated integer sequences for every document; after sorting them. So, it essentially boils down the (inefficient) solution of a string pattern matching problem to a better efficient integer matching problem.
